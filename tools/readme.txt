Run “make” to compile the new version of the application, but don’t run “make flash” as this would replace the factory version.
Go to the tools directory and execute the “update_firmware.py” script. The script takes two parameters, the IP address of the target and a path to the bin file of the application. On my machine, the command looks as follows:
$ python update_firmware.py 192.168.33.52 ../build/esp32-ota-demo.bin
